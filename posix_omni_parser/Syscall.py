    <Purpose>
      This object is used to describe a system call, holding all the information
      extracted from the trace file. The same object is used to describe system
      calls independently on which utility was used to generate the trace file.

    <Attributes>
      self.original_line:
        A string holding the original line from which this object was created.

      self.type:
        The type of the system call. This can be one of the UNFINISHED, RESUMED or
        COMPLETE.

      self.pid:
        The process id of this system call.

      self.name:
        The name of the system call.

      self.args:
        A tuple containing all the arguments of the system call. The value of each
        argument can be either a string or wrapped into a more meaningful class.

      self.ret:
        A tuple holding the return part of the system call. This tuple should
        always contain two items. The first one is the return value of the system
        call. The second is either a string holding the error label eg "EACCES"
        in case the system call had an error or None if the syscall executed
        correctly.

      self.inst_pointer:
        The instruction pointer at the time of the system call.

      self.timestamp:
        This value can have different formats and content according to the parser
        options. For example it can hold  a relative timestamp indicating the
        interval between the beginning of successive syscalls or it can hold the
        time the syscall was executed.

      self.elapsed_time:
        The time difference between the beginning and the end of the system call.
