<Purpose>
  This module holds a set of methods to parse a trace serialized as an AST.

  The path to a file generated must be passed to the constructor method 
  when initializing a StraceParser object. Then the parse_trace method 
  of the parser can be called, which will return a list of Syscall objects, 
  each containing all the information about a single system call parsed 
  from the AST

          trace_path:
            The path to the trace file containing the traced system calls. This file
            should contain the output of an originally generated AST object.

            The path to the pickle file containing the parsed system call
            representations.
